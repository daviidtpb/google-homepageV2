Hi, this is my second attempt at recreating the Google Home webpage with some few adjustments.

-I added the Google footer links at the bottom of the page
-Added the Google "About" and "Store" on the top Left
-Also instead of using the Google logo image itself and sourcing it I manually created the logo my self.
-Added hover effects
